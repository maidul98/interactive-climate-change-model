This visualization shows the user the various impacts of global warming on the earth over time. The topic of global warming has become an increasingly pressing issue, but it impacts such as rising sea levels (as the result of melting ice caps) as well as increasing global temperatures can be hard to fully grasp when looking at just numbers or percents. This visualization effectively translates these statistics into visually recognizable trends. Created using d3.js. Collaborators:  Jessica Tawade and Violet Turri
